# Hand_Gestures_Drawing_Application
This project is a real-time hand gesture drawing application that allows users to draw on a digital canvas using hand movements detected via a webcam. 

## **🎯 Introduction**  
This application allows users to draw on a virtual canvas using hand gestures detected via a webcam. It combines **computer vision (OpenCV + MediaPipe)** with a **Tkinter-based GUI** for an interactive drawing experience.  

## **🚀 Features**  
✔ **Hand Tracking** – Uses MediaPipe to detect finger positions.  
✔ **Pinch-to-Draw** – Close thumb and index finger to start drawing.  
✔ **Color Palette** – Choose from 5 different colors.  
✔ **Brush Customization** – Adjust brush size with a slider.  
✔ **Drawing Mode** – Toggle between drawing and navigation.  
✔ **Clear Function** – Reset the canvas instantly.  

## **⚙️ Installation**  
### **Prerequisites**  
- Python 3.7+  
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)  
- MediaPipe (`pip install mediapipe`)  
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)  
- Pillow (`pip install Pillow`)  

### **📌 Additional Notes**  
- The app works best in **good lighting conditions**.  
- For smoother tracking, ensure your **hand is clearly visible** in the webcam.  
- The **default brush size is 5**, but you can adjust it via the slider.
